# Causal Inference Projects

Project 1 Background

ACME Manufacturing, a company with over 60,000 employees, has launched the Career 2030 training program aimed at fostering the career development of its workforce. Despite its ongoing nature, the initial data from a randomly selected cohort of employees who participated in the training a year earlier has recently become available. ACME's Chief People Officer prioritizes data-informed decision-making and seeks insights into the program's impact on employee promotion and retention.

Problem

Your analytics consulting group, specializing in causal inference, is one of six firms being considered by ACME to continuously monitor the effects of various employee programs, including Career 2030. As a proof of concept, the client desires a demonstration of your analysis approach, insights derived from the data, and recommendations for program optimization. The dataset provided by the client originates from a randomized controlled trial, where 5% of employees were randomly selected for training while another 5% were not. However, external factors such as interventions by managers and individual motivations may have influenced participation. There were also anecdotal evidence that some managers intervened for direct reports to be part of the program. It is also a fact that some motivated employees may be more interested in the training program as well as upward mobility in their careers. Your task is to analyze this dataset within three weeks, extract insights, and provide actionable recommendations to the client, demonstrating your competence in supporting data-informed decision-making.

Project 2 Background

ACME Manufacturing, a leading direct seller of household goods in the US, has a widespread consumer base spanning all 50 states and Washington, DC. Leveraging the success of your consulting group's impactful work on the Career 2030 Impact Project, you've been endorsed by the Chief People Officer to the Chief Marketing Officer. The CMO, in the process of evaluating vendors for marketing effectiveness measurement services, is conducting a "bake-off" among six potential candidates.

Problem

Your analytics consulting group, specializing in causal inference, is among the contenders to continuously gauge the effectiveness of ACME's marketing campaigns. As a prerequisite, the client seeks a demonstration of your analytical approach, insights drawn from the data, and recommendations for optimizing marketing campaigns. The dataset spans two years of weekly order data across all 50 US states and Washington, DC. Your objective is to design a four-week experiment to measure the impact of a Google Performance MaxLinks to an external site. marketing campaign on a national scale. However, due to concurrent marketing activities, ACME has specified the candidate treatment markets as follows:

Delaware

Kansas

Kentucky

Tennessee

Missouri

Montana

Arkansas

Mississippi

New Mexico

Furthermore, these candidate markets cannot be utilized as control markets.

You have a timeframe of 10 days to design a geo holdout experiment. Once the treatment markets are identified, the client will disclose the observed orders in these markets over the course of four weeks. Your task involves analyzing the data, crafting an experiment, implementing causal inference techniques to derive insights, and delivering actionable recommendations. This showcases your proficiency in facilitating data-informed decision-making.
